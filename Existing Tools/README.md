## The scripts to run four existing accessibility checkers

- Each folder corresponds to an existing tool.
- Navigate into each folder, provide the URL of a web page, and run the program. It will return a list of accessibility issues.
- Please note that **A11yWatch** and **Wave** are paid services, so ensure you replace the api_key in the program accordingly.
