## The companion website of GenA11y

**The companion website for the paper *Enhancing Web Accessibility: Automated Detection of Issues with Generative AI*, submitted to FSE 2025, contains the following items:**

- The [study](https://github.com/GenA11y/GenA11y/tree/main/WCAG%20Study) on WCAG 2.2, including the methodology for classifying WCAG criteria and the results obtained.

- The [preliminary study](https://github.com/GenA11y/GenA11y/blob/main/Preliminary%20Study/Preliminary%20Study.md) was conducted on five university home pages. This study helped us identify challenges and select the most suitable prompting strategies.

- The [one-to-one comparison](https://gena11y.github.io/Coverage%20-%20One%20to%20One.html) regarding Coverage (RQ2).

- The [Augment Accessibility Tool Audit dataset](https://github.com/GenA11y/GenA11y/tree/main/Augmented%20Accessibility%20Tool%20Audit/tests), which consists of 148 web pages with accessibility issues. Each accessibility issue is grouped under a specific success criterion. For instance, 'buttons-empty-alt-attribute-on-image-button.html' is placed under 'SC 1.1.1'. This dataset is used for RQ1 Recall and the RQ4 Ablation Experiment.

- The [Ma11y](https://github.com/mahantaf/mahantaf.github.io/tree/main) dataset, from a previous study, includes accessibility issues that were programmatically injected into real web pages. This dataset is used for RQ1 Recall.

- The [scripts](https://github.com/GenA11y/GenA11y/tree/main/Existing%20Tools) to run four existing accessibility checkers. We used the IBM Equal Access in the browser, as it is a browser extension, and manually saved the scanned results.

- The [source code](https://github.com/GenA11y/GenA11y/tree/main/Source%20Code) of GenA11y

- The [models](https://github.com/GenA11y/GenA11y/tree/main/Source%20Code/py_src/Ablation%20Experiment) used in the ablation experiment

- The real websites used for RQ2 Coverage and RQ3 Precision are as follows:
