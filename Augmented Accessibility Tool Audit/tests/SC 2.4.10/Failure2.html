    <p>Web accessibility refers to designing websites and applications that can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. It involves various principles and techniques to ensure that content is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.</p>
    
    <p>One key aspect of web accessibility is ensuring that all content is perceivable. This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented, whether it is text, images, videos, or other media. To achieve this, web developers often use alt text for images, captions for videos, and ensure sufficient color contrast.</p>
    
    <p>Another important aspect is operability. This principle ensures that users can navigate and interact with a website or application. This includes providing keyboard accessibility, making interactive elements easily identifiable, and ensuring that users can understand the content and interface.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, web accessibility also involves understanding and implementing the WCAG guidelines, which provide a comprehensive set of criteria for making web content accessible.</p>
